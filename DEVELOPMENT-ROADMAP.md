## Next Steps

The platform has a solid foundation with modern UI/UX, database integration, and professional branding. The immediate focus should be on completing the core backend services (Database, Auth, Storage) to provide full functionality for users.

**Recommended Start**: Begin with Database Management features since the schema is already defined and the UI is built. This will provide immediate value and demonstrate the platform's capabilities.
