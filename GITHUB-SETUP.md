# GitHub Setup Instructions for NeoCore Platform

## Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since the Replit GitHub integration is having authorization issues, here's the manual setup process:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/stackstudio
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `neocore-platform`
4. Description: `Cyberpunk-themed backend development platform with AI tools and PostgreSQL database`
5. Visibility: Private (recommended for enterprise)
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Get Repository URL
After creation, GitHub will show you the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/stackstudio/neocore-platform.git
```

### Step 3: Manual Git Setup
In Replit's shell, run these commands (I'll help you with this):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/stackstudio/neocore-platform.git

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: NeoCore cyberpunk platform with database integration"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Team Import Process
Once the repository is created and pushed:

1. Team workspace â†’ "Import from GitHub"
2. Select `stackstudio/neocore-platform`
3. Database will auto-provision
4. Run `npm run dev` to start

### Authentication Notes
- Enterprise GitHub sometimes requires additional OAuth setup
- Personal access tokens may be needed for private repositories
- Contact your GitHub admin if authentication continues to fail
